# BotFlow -  a platform for creating contents for Rasa chatbots

## The Architecture

The BotFlow is developed using React JS and Redux for the frontend layer. The backend is developed with Django REST, in the [BotFlow API repository](https://github.com/lappis-unb/botFlowAPI).

The frontend is divided in Pages, Components and Ducks:
* **Ducks** - The ducks folder contains the actions and reducers for Intents, Uttters and Stories. It configures the store and have all the functions needed for data manipulation and API connection.
* **Components** - The application pages are componentized, and this folder contain all its separate compontents.
* **Pages** - Contain the website pages.

In [Tais architecture](https://lappis-unb.github.io/tais/documentacao/arquitetura/), this platform generates the training data.
