## Technologies Used
The BotFlow platform is developed through the use of the following technologies:

- React. JS - Used in our frontend layer

- Node. JS - Used in our backend layer for implementation of our API

- API - designed to handle data from creations and content edits within the BotFlow platform

- MongoDB - Used for construction of the database responsible for keeping the information added on the platform.

In addition our platform works with the export of data in the MarkDown format because it is the type of source format used in the creation of Chatbots implemented with the RASA framework.

## How to Contribute
To contribute to the BotFlow platform and facilitate the interaction of more people in creating and editing content is very easy!


-First we will enable a local environment for work, so just follow the step by step described below:
    
* Check Prerequisites:

    It is necessary to have a Docker or Node8 machine installed and (Yarn or NPM)

    * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

    * [Node8](https://nodejs.org/es/blog/release/v8.0.0/)

    * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/pt-BR/)

    * [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)


* Clone repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/lappis-unb/BotFlow`


- Climbing platform locally using Docker
    Make sure you are in the root folder of the project and run the command below:

    `sudo docker-compose -up --build`


- Climbing platform locally using NODE8 with Yarn
    Make sure it is in the app folder by running the command below

    `cd /app`

    Then run the following commands

     `yarn install`

    `yarn start`


- Climbing platform locally using NODE8 with NPM

Then the execution according to the choice of one of the previous operations, the platform will be available through access in:
    
`http://localhost:3000/`




- Now that you have understood how to enable the environment locally, we will be very happy to receive and incorporate your contributions. For this we have some additional information about the style of the Code and documentation.

    In general the process is very simple:


    - Create an issue in our repository describing a feature that you want to work with
